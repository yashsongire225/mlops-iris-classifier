# Version Control Workflow — [mlops-iris-classifier]
## 1. Overview
This document describes the Git-based version control workflow used for this
Machine Learning project, developed as part of MLOps Lab Experiment 2.
- **Repository:** https://github.com/yashsongire225/mlops-iris-classifier
- **Primary language:** Python
- **Maintainer(s):** yashsongire225
## 2. Branching Strategy
| Branch            | Purpose                                             |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `main`             | Stable, always-deployable code                       |
| `develop`          | Integration branch for day-to-day development         |
| `feature/<name>`   | Individual features, branched from and merged back into `develop` |
| `conflict-demo-*`  | Demonstration branches created for conflict resolution practice |

**Rule:** No one commits directly to `main`. All changes flow:
`feature/*` → Pull Request → `develop` → (periodically) merged into `main`.

## 3. Commit Convention
Commits follow a short, imperative style with a type prefix:
## feat: add new functionality fix: correct a bug docs: documentation changes chore: tooling/config changes refactor: code change with no behavior change
Example: `feat: add classification report to training script`

## 4. Standard Workflow (Feature Development)
```bash
git switch develop
git pull origin develop
git switch -c feature/<short-description>
# ... make changes ...
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat: <description>"
git push -u origin feature/<short-description>
# Open a Pull Request into `develop` on GitHub
# After review/approval, merge via GitHub (squash or merge commit)
git branch -d feature/<short-description>          # clean up locally
git push origin --delete feature/<short-description> # clean up remote
```

## 5. Merge Conflict Resolution Process
1. Attempt the merge/rebase; Git flags conflicting files.
2. Open each conflicted file and locate `<<<<<<<` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>` markers.
3. Decide which change(s) to keep — current, incoming, or a manual combination.
4. Remove all conflict markers.
5. `git add <file>` to mark the conflict as resolved.
6. `git commit` (or continue the rebase) to finalize.
7. Test the code (`python src/train.py`) before pushing to confirm nothing broke.

## 6. .gitignore Policy for ML Artifacts
Large or generated files are excluded from Git and are expected to be tracked
separately (e.g., via DVC, cloud storage, or Git-LFS) rather than committed directly:
- Raw/processed datasets (`data/*.csv`, `data/*.parquet`)
- Model checkpoints/binaries (`*.pkl`, `*.h5`, `*.pt`, `models/`)
- Virtual environments (`.venv/`, `venv/`, `env/`)
- Notebook checkpoints (`.ipynb_checkpoints/`)

## 7. Pull Request Checklist
- [ ] Code runs without errors (`python src/train.py`)
- [ ] No large data/model files accidentally staged
- [ ] Commit messages follow the convention in §3
- [ ] Branch is up to date with `develop` before merging
- [ ] PR description explains *what* changed and *why*

## 8. Verification Log
| Check                                              | Status |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `git --version` ≥ 2.30                              | ✅ |
| `git log --oneline --graph --all` shows merged branches | ✅ |
| Repository has 3+ branches                          | ✅ |
| Repository has 1+ merged Pull Request                | ✅ |
| `python src/train.py` runs and prints Accuracy       | ✅ |

## 9. Lessons Learned / Notes
[Add any project-specific notes here — e.g., recurring conflict areas,
naming conventions adopted, tools used (gh CLI vs web UI), etc.]
